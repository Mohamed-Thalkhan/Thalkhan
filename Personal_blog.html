            <h2>Welcome to My Tech Journey!</h2>
            <p>Hello there! I'm Mohamed Thalkhan, a passionate and dedicated web developer with a strong background in technical support. I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) from Syed Hameedha Arts and Science College, where I honed my skills in programming, web development, and IT support.</p>
            <p>In this blog, I'll take you through my journey, my achievements, and my aspirations as I navigate the ever-evolving world of technology.</p>

        <section id="early-life">
            <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
            <p>My story begins in Ramanathapuram, India, where I was born and raised. My curiosity for technology started at a young age, leading me to pursue my interest in computers and programming. I completed my schooling at Bukhariya Matriculation Higher Secondary School, where I developed a strong foundation in commerce. Despite my commerce background, my passion for technology pushed me to explore the world of coding and web development.</p>

        <section id="education">
            <h2>My Academic Journey</h2>
            <p>After completing my higher secondary education with a focus on commerce, I decided to follow my passion for technology and enrolled in the BCA program at Syed Hameedha Arts and Science College. During my time in college, I immersed myself in learning various programming languages and tools that are essential for web development. My hard work paid off, and I graduated in 2024 with a respectable 71% score.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="development">
            <h2>Exploring Web Development</h2>
            <p>Web development quickly became my area of expertise and passion. I love the creative process of building websites and web applications from scratch. During my college years, I took on several projects that allowed me to apply my skills in real-world scenarios. One of my most notable projects was developing an E-Learning Management System, which provided teachers and students with a platform to manage learning materials, quizzes, and assignments.</p>
            <p>Another significant project I worked on was a Hospital Management System, where I implemented user roles and access control for patients, doctors, and admins. These projects not only enhanced my technical skills but also taught me the importance of user-centric design and efficient data management.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="internship">
            <h2>Internships and Certifications</h2>
            <p>To further enhance my skills, I pursued a web development internship at Skillvertex, where I gained hands-on experience in building and maintaining web applications. I worked extensively with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL to create dynamic and responsive websites. This internship was a valuable experience that allowed me to apply my academic knowledge in a professional setting.</p>
            <p>In addition to my internship, I earned several certifications that have strengthened my technical portfolio. These include certifications in Microsoft 360, Web Development Training from Skillvertex, Web Development from IBM SkillBuild, MERN Stack Development from GUVI, and Programming in Python from GUVI.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="hobbies">
            <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
            <p>Outside of my academic and professional life, I have a deep interest in video editing, graphic design, and PC building. I enjoy the process of creating visually appealing content and optimizing computer systems for better performance. These hobbies not only provide me with a creative outlet but also keep me updated with the latest trends in digital media and technology.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="achievements">
            <h2>Achievements and Leadership Roles</h2>

I won 1st Prize in a Poster Making competition, secured 2nd Prize in a C Programming contest, and earned 2nd Prize in a College Hackathon. These achievements have motivated me to continue pushing the boundaries of my capabilities.</p>
            <p>During my school days, I had the honor of being the captain of the football team and the leader of my class. These leadership roles taught me the importance of teamwork, communication, and responsibilityâ€”skills that have been invaluable in both my academic and professional life.</p>
